We are on a mission to make the process of buying and selling easier and more convenient - and with your help, it will be possible. But before we work together, we would like to assess your programming abilities.

Please find the small assignment below, that we would like for you to complete in the allotted time. (If you are reading this, the clock is already ticking).

## YOUR TASK: Create a reusable payment interface with coupon feature and a matching API

Use the programming languages that are to your comfort.
This project should be built using as few dependencies as possible but as many as needed.

The overall result should look more or less like this: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83538455/124125857-1b675c00-da8b-11eb-9f84-b7d4212be67f.png)

We believe, for an ideal candidate, this should not take more than a couple of hours.

### Whats Expected
Create a reusable payment interface for credit cards in React and a matching API
- Implement reusable components
- We do expect you to create and use proper component hierarchy keeping service and components exclusive.
- Add form validation for all the fields!
- Implement styling in a way that allows clear separation between components
- Implement a field discount code which after hitting 'Apply' will validate the provided coupon code via an API call
- Submitting the payment should call the API and either show a success message or not
- Please use git version control

Create a payment API interface to handle interaction with the UI
- Implement models to accomplish the project
- Setup the required database structures and migrations (You are free to use any database that you like but SQL preferred)
- Setup the required endpoints to handle the requests from the UI
- Validate the API request and think about security of payment and coupon validation
- Handle expiry of coupon codes. Think about edge cases.

General tasks
- Setup an easy to understand README or documentation to understand how to use your application
- Setup an automated flow via Docker / Docker-Compose to start both backend and frontend

### Good to have
- Proper handling of error message and no results screens.
- Clean UI similar to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dubizzle-onboarding/gistapi/main/design_inspiration.png).
- Unit Tests.
- Optimised rendering.
- Code comments.
- Type checking of the params.

Bonus
- Implement the UI in React Native with Web Output to be reusable across platforms

### Thank you
We thank you for your effort and time and good luck.
